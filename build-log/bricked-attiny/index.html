  <h1>My first ATTiny! And I just bricked it.</h1>
  <p class="pagemeta">October 28, 2020</p>
  <p>After I got the <a href="/build-log/working-brushless-motor-prototype/">brushless motor prototype</a> working I needed a short break from 3D stuff like laser-cutting and gluing and winding coils, so I chose to give the ATTiny microcontroller a spin. Here it is sitting on its &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; breadboard, accompanied by its big brother, the Arduino Nano that is used as an ad-hoc programmer.</p>
<p><img src="/images/040-attiny-breadboard.jpg#narrow" alt="ATTiny45 and Arduino Nano"></p>
<p>I fell in love with the ATTiny because of its simplicity. Yes, the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; microcontrollers like the various Arduinos or the ESP32 are also impressively small and accessible. But they still come with a breakout board with two dozen or more pins, a USB socket, in the ESP&rsquo;s case even WiFi and Bluetooth&hellip; It&rsquo;s a lot. In contrast, with the ATTiny45 or ATTiny85:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have a single chip with 4 pins on both sides, and that&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have a very forgiving supply voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V, or down to a minimum of 1.8 V with other variants like the ATTiny404 (more on that later).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need very little power: between 8 mA for 8 MHz at 5 V, down to 0.7 mA for 1 MHz at 3 V. And this goes down to <em>ridiculously</em> little power in sleep mode, measured in single-digit μA. This, together with the generous voltage range, is exactly what I need in a solar-cell-powered setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing software for these chips is also a different experience altogether. Your limits are something like 512 bytes to 4 KB of Flash for your code and 64 to 512 bytes of RAM. This is getting exciting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have an EEPROM so I can store the &ldquo;lifetime revolutions&rdquo; count persistently before the chip shuts down each night. These EEPROMs last for about 100 thousand write cycles, which means that even if I write the value twice every day, I have over 100 years of expected lifetime. I can live with that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programming-an-attiny">Programming an ATTiny</h3>
<p>There are really lots of tutorials and examples out there, so I won&rsquo;t bore your with details. You write and compile your code in <a href="https://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>, but to upload, you need an extra device (the programmer) that has a USB connection. You can buy dedicated gadgets for this, but it makes a lot more sense to use an Arduino. So that setup means your PC talks to the Arduino, which is easy because you can plug the Arduino directly into a USB port. The Arduino, in turn, talks to the ATTiny chip over 4 wires, plus supplies it with power over 2 additional wires. This is documented in tons of tutorials, like this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-ISP-to-ATTiny85/">Instructable</a> or this German <a href="https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Erste-Schritte-mit-den-Mikrocontrollern-ATtiny84-und-85-4399393.html">article</a>.</p>
<p>There are only a few things worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As an ATTiny programmer, the Arduino Nano itself must be programmed first. For this step it&rsquo;s easiest to go through the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino IDE</a>, which contains the sketch as one of the pre-installed examples. Once you&rsquo;ve uploaded the sketch, you can forget about the Arduino IDE again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 10 μF capacitor between the Arduino&rsquo;s GND and RST pins really got me. I thought it worked like the capacitor you use with the ESP32 in that it allows you to upload a new sketch without having to press Reset. On the contrary, if it&rsquo;s there, your sketch won&rsquo;t upload &ndash; a fact that caused me an hour&rsquo;s worth of frustration before I RTFM&rsquo;ed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The breadboard you see on the photo is a combination of two things. It&rsquo;s an ATTiny programmer for uploading new code, and it&rsquo;s a testbed to see how that code executes. I plugged the chip into a socket, not directly into the breadboard, to spare the pins. I can put the socket where it is in the picture for &ldquo;run mode,&rdquo; or I can move it right next to the Arduino for &ldquo;programming mode.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you see on the breadboard is of course the &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; of microcontrollers: an LED connected to an output pin with a current limiting resistor. The program blinks the LED. Magic ensues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="messing-up-the-clock">Messing up the clock</h3>
<p>Once I figured out the capacitor trick with the Arduino, writing and uploading the first little program for the ATTiny was easy. There&rsquo;s one very funny detail that the German article correctly points out at the end: the Arduino code library makes an assumption about the microcontroller&rsquo;s CPU frequency. But by default the ATTiny runs at 1 MHz instead of the library&rsquo;s assumption of 8 MHz, so the <code>delay</code> in the code below takes 8 times as long.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>So far so good! But now I tasted blood and realized that it&rsquo;s possible to <em>programmatically</em> change the ATTiny&rsquo;s CPU clock &ndash; and why wouldn&rsquo;t you do that if you can? It&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/05/16/change-attiny85-clock-speed-on-the-fly/">documented here</a> and all it takes is a few lines of code like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-C++" data-lang="C++"><span style="color:#75715e">// Change to 2 MHz by changing clock prescaler to 4

</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>sei();                <span style="color:#75715e">// Enable interrupts
</span></code></pre></div><p>There are two details that none of the pages I visited seemed to mention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The value you write into CLKPR is interpreted as &ldquo;2 to the power of N&rdquo;, and <em>not</em> as N. This seems to be a case where someone published an article somewhere without explaining what&rsquo;s going on, and then this snippet got copied by others who also didn&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on, and it&rsquo;s such a fringe thing that nobody really notices or bothers to fix the example. I got the explanation included in the code snippet above from a comment buried deep down under a little-visited article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you change the CPU clock prescaler, then the next time you want to upload new code into the ATTiny&rsquo;s Flash, you have to adjust the serial bus&rsquo;s frequency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This latter part is what got me. I successfully reduced my first ATTiny45&rsquo;s clock speed to 128 kHz, and could never upload another program again. I was apparently <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=182138.0">not the first one to run into this</a>. It is probably possible to reset this chip physically, but the number of hours I would need to get there is way more than what the chip is worth. So now I have this sad guy lying around &ndash; a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_construction#%22Dead_bug%22_construction">dead bug</a>, for all intents and purposes.</p>
